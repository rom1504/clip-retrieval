● There are multiple dependency conflicts that need to be resolved. Let me continue with the CI workflow updates first, then we'll address the dependency issues. Let me finish
  updating the CI workflow:

● Now I need to address the dependency conflicts. The issues are:
  1. img2dataset versions have conflicts with pyarrow, wandb, fire, and webdataset
  2. autofaiss has conflicts with pyarrow and fire

  Let me update the requirements to fix these conflicts:
